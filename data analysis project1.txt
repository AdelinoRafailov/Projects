

Scope of Project :

Analyse and Visualize Hotel Booking Data.

QUESTIONS

1) Is hotel revenue growing by year?
There is an increase of revenue by each year from 2018 to 2020
As shown in the dashboard in power-bi

2) Is necessary to increase Parking spaces?
 
As seeing from the data per client the demand for parking spaces is very low.
Creating new parking spaces will be an excess expenditure from the budget of the hotel.
there are 1352 parking spaces which where optimised within the period of 2018
and 2237 in 2020.



3)What trends can we see in the data?

The trends that we can see from 2018 begginning revenue is low till beggining of june where it goes uphill , the hotel is seasonal works better in summer.
in 2019 we see a slight increase but corellating with 2018 it is a bad year for the hotel profits wise.
 January 2020 we see an increase in revenue till the end of summer is the highest revenue year.






SQL STEPS:

First by checking the data with the selected command:

 select * from dbo.[‘2018$’]

union

select * from dbo.[‘2019$’]

union

select * from dbo.[‘2020$’]

With UNION will combine the multiple statements together.



Since in the database there is no revenue column will create one 
By : adding two columns: stays_in_week_nights+stays_in_weekend_nights From hotels.
 After will multiple them by the ADR = daily rate.


“ Select
Arrival_date_year,
Sum(stays_in_week_nights+stays_in_weekend_nights)*adr as revenue
From hotels
Group by arrival_date_year



















select 
arrival_date_year,
hotel,
round (sum((stays_in_week_nights+stays_in_weekend_nights)*adr),2) as revenue 
from hotels
group by arrival_date_year,hotel

--------------------------------------------------

with hotels as (
select * from dbo.['2018$']
union
select * from dbo.['2019$']
union
select * from dbo.['2020$'])

select * from hotels
left join dbo.market_segment$
on hotels.market_segment = market_segment$.market_segment
left join 
dbo.meal_cost$ 
on meal_cost$.meal =hotels.meal
